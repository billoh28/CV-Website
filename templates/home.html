            <h4>Orthodox MMA Trainer - Final Year Thesis</h4>
            <br>
            <p>For my final year thesis, my project partner and I created a progressive web application which utilised pose estimation and computer vision to predict a user's technique / form in regards to certain strikes used within mixed martial arts, such as a jab.</p>

            <p>We created datasets by recording poor and proper technique, reducing the dimensioanlity of the data and then feeding this data to <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html">BlazePose.</a> This is a pose estimation pipeline which was cutting edge at the time. It produces pose estimations, frame-by-frame, in the form of 32 pose landmarks. This data was then used to create datasets and train multiple classifiers.</p>

            <p>The web application was written using Flask, Python, Javascript (used for video encoding), HTML and CSS, and was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. GoLang was also used to produce an API for storing feedback reports produced by users and user authentification.</p>

            <h4>Sign Language Translator - Third Year Project</h4>
            <br>
    
            <p>As our third year project, my project partner and I designed and trained Neural Networks to translate Irish Sign Language from prerecorded video into audio.</p>
            <p>The program we produced utilised Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision libraries, such as Keras and Numpy, and was written in Python.</p>
    
            <br>
    
            <p>The functions of this program are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Converts a video into frames, applying image processing to convert the frames into multi-dimensional arrays and feed them to a trained CNN model.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Accumulates the output of the CNN models to plain text.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Convert the text produced by the CNN into audio, and save the audio file into the current working directory.</p></li>
                </ul>
    
            <br>
    
            <p>The graph and confusion matrix below depict the accuracy of the ensemble model. The orange line in the graph shows the number of correct predictions for that letter sign pair in a test dataset, while the blue line is the number of incorrect predictions for that pair.</p>

            <p>This communication channel has the potential to greatly decrease the impacts of deafness, and other communication disorders, which could reduce loneliness and isolation in these communities.</p>
    
            <p>We received a first class honours in this project.</p>

            <h4>Network API - Alternate Intra</h4>
            <br>
            <p>This was part of a DCU group project meant to replicate work placement for those who lost their jobs due to COVID-19.</p>
            <p>I worked alongside a fellow software engineering student to develop a Network API for a network of smart hand sanitiser devices. The API was wrote in Python 3 using Flask as a framework.</p>
            <p>Functions of the API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Records usage statistics of the individual hand sanitiser dispensers.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Performs data analytics on the usage statistics.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Displays status of diapensers, usage statistics and data analytics report at specified endpoints requiring an API key.</p></li>
                </ul>
    
            <p>The GitLab repository this code is contained within is private as it contains Firebase credentials.</p>
